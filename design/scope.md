# Scope

## Goals

- Highly configurable and customizable
- Easy to test; fast development workflow

## Non-Goals

Loglang does **not** attempt to satisfy any of these goals:

- Predictive alerting based on metrics forecasting. Use some other tool for that and have it generate events.
- Highly scalable. Other systems like Logstash and Vector are good for that.
